## Tutorial
To run the code locally please follow the instructions
 * Download the folder using:
```
git clone https://github.com/Davi1990/mne_eeg_workshop/
```

```
cd folder_path_to_the_cloned_repo
```

 * Install the required dependencies using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

 * Download the required [data folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DO-dXfIXzGDzmgcWRMtYvX30ZECYzRYd?usp=sharing)

 * Download the [raw file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-RSyaXp2Chx0zLuaAnlgK8o1VMo3enx8/view?usp=share_link)

 * Start a new jupyter notebook. For this follow the instructions below:
       - Open the terminal
       - Type jupyter notebook
       - If youâ€™re not automatically directed to a webpage copy the URL printed in the terminal and paste it in your browser
       - Once on the webpage, navigate to the `mne_eeg_workshop` you cloned.
       - upload the notebook associated with notebook.
       
## Exercise

1. Read through the notebook running all the cells
2. Complete the exercises in the notebook

**Exercise 1** Check information on the MNE-BIDS file that was saved as part of Tutorial 01 and fill the cells in the notebook with your answers to the questions below.

       How many channels do you have for each type of sensor?
       What is the sampling frequency?
       Have the data been filtered?
       What is the frequency of the line noise?
       Is there any bad channel?
       

**Exercise 2** Import a new epoched file and generate figure of both evoked response and principal components

        Read the file 'sub-s01_task-faceFO_eeg.fif' as an epoched object
        Make a joint plot of the time-series?
        Create a variable with the array of the evoked data
        Decompose the data using SVD (use the function numpy.linalg.svd)
        Make a matplotlib figure with 1 row and 5 columns and plot the first 5 components using the function mne.viz.plot_topomap


After finishing each of your exercise, rename the notebook and save it to your local with your answers to share with your TA(s).
Follow up with your local TA(s) to validate you completed the exercises correctly
